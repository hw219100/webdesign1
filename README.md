# Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Arc
## a film by Steven Speilberg
Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of my favorite movies because it blends action, adventure, and history. Harrison Fordâ€™s performance as Indiana Jones created one of the most iconic characters in cinema history. My personal favorite parts of the movie are the incredible soundtrack by John Williams, who is known for composing some of the best action-adventure scores, such as the main theme in Jurassic Park. I also really enjoy the sets in the film, which have a unique vintage jungle aesthetic that adds to the overall atmosphere.
